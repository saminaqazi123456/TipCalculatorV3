## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [X] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [X] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:
* [X] Colors, fonts, UI changed.
* [X] UserDefaults used to persist data across app restarts.

- [X] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Required features are all complete. A few optional features are also implemented as checked above. Setting screens is also added and changing the Settings updates the calculations. Can add more optional features.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Tried to research the currency locale but it needed more time to work correctly, so removed that functionality. Data persistence and refreshing the calculations based on Settings screen took longer than expected.
